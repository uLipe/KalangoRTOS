## 1. Philosophy and Directory Layout

The arch layer is a **contract**, not a library.  It isolates
platform-independent kernel logic from hardware-specific implementation.

```
kernel/          platform-independent (scheduler, IPC, memory, IRQ table)
                 calls ulmk_arch_* only
                 exports ulmk_kernel_* callbacks

arch/
└── <arch>/      one subdirectory per supported ISA
    ├── arch.c           main implementation
    ├── ctx_switch.S     context switch (assembly)
    ├── startup.S        _start — CPU prologue only, jumps to ulmk_kern_start
    ├── vectors.S        trap/ISR entry stubs
    └── include/
        ├── ulmk_arch.h        arch contract header (types + prototypes)
        └── arch_config.h    arch-specific constants (MPU region count, etc.)
```

Adding a new architecture means creating a new `arch/<name>/` subtree that
satisfies every symbol declared in `ulmk_arch.h`.  See `docs/arch_porting_guide.md`.

---

## 2. Dependency Rules

```
kernel/ → arch/ via ulmk_arch.h only
arch/   → kernel/ via ulmk_kernel_* callbacks only
board/  → nothing above it
```

Violations:

- `kernel/` must **never** include arch implementation headers directly.
- `arch/` must **never** include `kernel/` internal headers.
- Arch code must not encode scheduling policy (it calls `ulmk_kern_irq_dispatch()`
  and `ulmk_kern_sched_dispatch()` from generic ISR stubs).
- Kernel code must not contain ISA-specific instructions or register names.

---

## 3. Arch Types

Each arch defines these types in its `ulmk_arch.h`:

### `ulmk_arch_ctx_t` — saved CPU context

```c
typedef struct {
    /* arch-defined fields; must be the FIRST field of ulmk_thread_t */
    ...
} ulmk_arch_ctx_t;
```

Must be the **first field** of `ulmk_thread_t` so the assembly context-switch
path can access it at a known offset without depending on the full TCB layout.

The struct must encode enough state to resume the thread via `ulmk_arch_ctx_switch`.
On register-file architectures this is typically a saved-PC + stack-pointer; on
architectures with hardware-managed context (like TriCore's CSA) it is a link
to the saved frame chain.

### `ulmk_arch_irq_key_t` — saved interrupt state

```c
typedef <arch-defined> ulmk_arch_irq_key_t;
```

Opaque value returned by `ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_save()` and passed to
`ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_restore()`.  Must encode enough state to restore the previous
interrupt enable / mask level exactly.

### `ulmk_arch_region_t` — MPU region descriptor

```c
typedef struct {
    uintptr_t base;
    size_t    size;
    uint32_t  perms;    /* UL_PERM_* bitmask */
    uint8_t   type;     /* UL_REGION_* tag */
} ulmk_arch_region_t;

#define ULMK_REGION_CODE    0
#define ULMK_REGION_DATA    1
#define ULMK_REGION_STACK   2
#define ULMK_REGION_HEAP    3
#define ULMK_REGION_PERIPH  4
#define ULMK_REGION_SHARED  5
```

`perms` uses the same `ULMK_PERM_READ | ULMK_PERM_WRITE | ULMK_PERM_EXEC | ULMK_PERM_USER`
flags defined in `include/ulmk/microkernel.h`.

---

## 4. CPU Control

### `ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_save` / `ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_restore`

```c
ulmk_arch_irq_key_t ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_save(void);
void              ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_restore(ulmk_arch_irq_key_t key);
```

Disable interrupts globally and save/restore the previous state.  The save/restore
pair is re-entrant: nested calls must restore the outermost state only when the
outermost restore is reached.

### `ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_enable` / `ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_disable`

```c
void ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_enable(void);
void ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_disable(void);
```

Unconditional enable / disable.  Used in boot and shutdown paths where no
previous state needs to be preserved.

### `ulmk_arch_cpu_idle`

```c
void ulmk_arch_cpu_idle(void);
```

Enter a low-power wait state until the next interrupt.  Called by the kernel
idle thread.  Must return when an interrupt fires and is handled (i.e., after
the ISR completes).

**Hard rule:** idle must never call the scheduler (`ulmk_kern_sched_dispatch`,
`ulmk_sched_*` switch paths, or equivalent).  Preemption happens only on
ISR/syscall exit.  Arch IPI quirks must be fixed so the hardware interrupt
vectors; do not poll a soft mailbox from idle.

### SMP — `ulmk_arch_cpu_id` / spinlocks / IPI / secondary

```c
uint32_t          ulmk_arch_cpu_id(void);              /* 0 .. NUM_CPU-1 */
void              ulmk_arch_spin_lock(ulmk_spinlock_t *l);
void              ulmk_arch_spin_unlock(ulmk_spinlock_t *l);
ulmk_arch_irq_key_t ulmk_arch_spin_lock_irqsave(ulmk_spinlock_t *l);
void              ulmk_arch_spin_unlock_irqrestore(ulmk_spinlock_t *l,
						  ulmk_arch_irq_key_t k);
void              ulmk_arch_send_ipi(uint32_t cpu_id);  /* soft resched */
void              ulmk_arch_secondary_init(void);
void              ulmk_arch_start_secondary(uint32_t cpu_id, void (*entry)(void));
void              ulmk_arch_smp_mark_ready(void);       /* CPU0 post-bss gate */
```

`ULMK_ARCH_NUM_CPU` is a board constant (default 1).  `ULMK_CONFIG_ENABLE_SMP`
may only be 1 when `NUM_CPU > 1`.  Kernel effective CPU count is `ULMK_NR_CPUS`
(= `NUM_CPU` if SMP else 1).

Affinity is a permanent `uint8_t cpu` on `ulmk_thread_attr_t` / TCB — no
migration.  Shared pools use `spin_lock_irqsave` (irq_save alone is not
enough under SMP).  With `ENABLE_SMP=0`, `spin_lock`/`unlock` are no-ops and
`spin_lock_irqsave` reduces to `cpu_irq_save`/`restore` (UP path).

| Arch | SMP notes |
|------|-----------|
| RISC-V | `mhartid`, LR/SC spin, CLINT MSIP IPI; QEMU `-smp 2/4` |
| TriCore | `CORE_ID`, CAS spin, GPSR soft IPI; TC275 Lite brings up CPU0+CPU1+CPU2 |
| ARM | UP only — configure refuses `ENABLE_SMP` |

Remote enqueue sets `ipi_pending` and `ulmk_sched_kick_pending()` sends the
IPI via GPSR SETR (+ `INT_SRB` TRIG on TC27x); the ISR exit calls
`ulmk_kern_ipi_from_isr`.  Each TriCore core also arms its own STM CMP0 tick
and timing wheel (`ulmk_arch_timer_wheel_cpu` → `cpu_id`).  Idle must not
drain a soft mailbox or call the scheduler.

### `ulmk_arch_cpu_halt`

```c
void ulmk_arch_cpu_halt(void);
```

Hard halt with interrupts disabled.  Used by the panic path.  Must not return.

### `ulmk_arch_cpu_clz`

```c
uint32_t ulmk_arch_cpu_clz(uint32_t val);
```

Count leading zeros of `val`.  Used by the O(1) bitmap scheduler.  Implement
with the native ISA instruction when available; fall back to a software loop.

---

## 5. Context Management

### `ulmk_arch_ctx_init`

```c
void ulmk_arch_ctx_init(ulmk_arch_ctx_t *ctx,
                      void (*entry)(void *arg), void *arg,
                      uintptr_t stack_top, ulmk_privilege_t priv);
```

Fabricate the initial saved context for a new thread.  After this call,
`ulmk_arch_ctx_switch(NULL, ctx)` must start executing `entry(arg)` at privilege
`priv` using the stack whose top is `stack_top`.

Implementations typically push a synthetic register frame onto the stack or
(for hardware-managed context) allocate a saved-context frame in a pool.

A trampoline must ensure that if `entry` returns, `ulmk_thread_exit()` is called.

### `ulmk_arch_ctx_switch`

```c
void ulmk_arch_ctx_switch(ulmk_arch_ctx_t *from, const ulmk_arch_ctx_t *to);
```

Suspend the current thread by saving its CPU state into `*from`, then resume
the thread whose state is in `*to`.  Does not return to the caller until the
current thread is switched back to.

If `from` is NULL, the function performs a one-way jump to `to` (used for the
first task load).

The kernel guarantees that interrupts are disabled when this is called.

### `ulmk_arch_ctx_free`

```c
void ulmk_arch_ctx_free(ulmk_arch_ctx_t *ctx);
```

Release any arch-managed resources associated with `ctx` (e.g., saved-context
frames from a hardware pool).  Called when a thread is killed.  Must be safe to
call from any context with interrupts disabled.

On TriCore `ulmk_arch_ctx_switch` and ISR preempt only swap `pcxi` — **O(1)**.
Assembly calls `ulmk_arch_ctx_post_save()` after storing `pcxi` (one CSA link
read + `dsync`; not a chain walk).  `ulmk_arch_ctx_free()` walks the saved CSA
chain to the terminal frame and splices the whole list onto FCX — **O(chain
depth)**, cold path only (same model as Zephyr `z_tricore_reclaim_csa`).

---

## 6. MPU — Memory Protection Unit

### `ulmk_arch_mpu_init`

```c
void ulmk_arch_mpu_init(void);
```

One-time MPU initialisation.  Set up a privileged protection domain (PRS 0 on
TriCore, region 0 on ARMv7-M, etc.) with full kernel access.  Called once from
`ulmk_arch_init()` before the scheduler starts.

### `ulmk_arch_mpu_enable` / `ulmk_arch_mpu_disable`

```c
void ulmk_arch_mpu_enable(void);
void ulmk_arch_mpu_disable(void);
```

Activate / deactivate hardware memory protection.  After `ulmk_arch_mpu_enable()`
returns, accesses outside configured regions must trigger a hardware fault.

### `ulmk_arch_mpu_configure`

```c
void ulmk_arch_mpu_configure(uint8_t prs, const ulmk_arch_region_t *regions,
                            uint8_t count);
```

Program `count` regions into protection domain `prs`.  On architectures with
a Protection Register Set model (e.g., TriCore DPR/CPR), `prs` identifies the
set.  On flat-region architectures (e.g., ARMv7-M MPU), `prs` is a logical
slot that the port maps to hardware regions.

### `ulmk_arch_mpu_switch`

```c
void ulmk_arch_mpu_switch(const ulmk_arch_region_t *regions, uint8_t count,
                         uint8_t prs);
```

Fast domain switch at context switch time.  Must be as cheap as possible; on
architectures that support it (e.g., TriCore `PSW.PRS` field), this is a
single register write.

### `ulmk_arch_mpu_addr_permitted`

```c
bool ulmk_arch_mpu_addr_permitted(uintptr_t addr, size_t size, uint32_t perms);
```

Return true if `[addr, addr+size)` is accessible with `perms` in the currently
active protection domain.  Used by the kernel to validate syscall pointer
arguments before dereferencing them.

---

## 7. IRQ Control

### `ulmk_arch_irq_vectors_init`

```c
void ulmk_arch_irq_vectors_init(uintptr_t trap_table, uintptr_t irq_table,
                               uintptr_t isr_stack_top);
```

Register the trap/interrupt vector tables with hardware and set the ISR stack
pointer.  On architectures where trap and interrupt tables are separate, both
addresses are provided; use the appropriate one for the ISA.

Must be called before `ulmk_arch_cpu_irq_enable()`.

### `ulmk_arch_irq_src_configure`

```c
void ulmk_arch_irq_src_configure(uint8_t srpn, uint8_t priority, uint8_t cpu_id);
```

Configure interrupt source `srpn` (Service Request Priority Number — a logical
index into the interrupt controller).  Set its priority and target CPU.  Leave
it disabled; `ulmk_arch_irq_src_enable()` activates it.

### `ulmk_arch_irq_src_enable` / `ulmk_arch_irq_src_disable`

```c
void ulmk_arch_irq_src_enable(uint8_t srpn);
void ulmk_arch_irq_src_disable(uint8_t srpn);
```

Enable / disable interrupt source `srpn` in the interrupt controller.

### `ulmk_arch_irq_src_ack`

```c
void ulmk_arch_irq_src_ack(uint8_t srpn);
```

Clear the pending flag for `srpn`.  Required after handling a level-triggered
interrupt to prevent immediate re-entry.

### `ulmk_arch_irq_src_is_pending`

```c
bool ulmk_arch_irq_src_is_pending(uint8_t srpn);
```

Return true if `srpn` has a pending interrupt request.

### `ulmk_arch_irq_src_trigger`

```c
void ulmk_arch_irq_src_trigger(uint8_t srpn);
```

Software-trigger interrupt `srpn`.  Used only in test builds to inject
synthetic hardware events.

---

## 8. Tick Timer

The arch provides a periodic tick that advances the kernel timing wheel
(`ulmk_kern_timer_tick` → `ulmk_timer_tick`).

### `ulmk_arch_tick_init` / `ulmk_arch_tick_ack`

```c
void     ulmk_arch_tick_init(uint32_t tick_hz);
void     ulmk_arch_tick_ack(void);
uint32_t ulmk_arch_timer_wheel_cpu(void);
```

- `tick_init` — program the hardware compare / systick for `tick_hz`
  (usually `ULMK_CONFIG_TICK_HZ`).  Called from `ulmk_tick_start()` and from
  each secondary CPU entry on arches with a per-hart timer.
- `tick_ack` — clear/re-arm the compare from the tick ISR path.
- `timer_wheel_cpu` — index of the timing wheel used by `ulmk_timer_add` /
  `ulmk_timer_tick` on this hart.  All current ports return
  `ulmk_arch_cpu_id()` (local tick → per-CPU wheel).  TriCore uses STM0/1/2
  CMP0 + `SRC_STMx_SR0` per core; remote enqueue still uses GPSR IPI for a
  prompt wake.

### `ulmk_arch_irq_src_register`

```c
void ulmk_arch_irq_src_register(uint8_t srpn, uint32_t src_reg_addr);
```

Record the absolute address of the SRC register for `srpn` (TriCore).  Called
from the kernel when userspace invokes `ulmk_irq_bind_hw()`.

---

## 9. Atomic Operations

### `ulmk_arch_atomic_cas`

```c
uint32_t ulmk_arch_atomic_cas(volatile uint32_t *ptr,
                             uint32_t expected, uint32_t desired);
```

Compare-and-swap.  If `*ptr == expected`, atomically write `desired` and return
`expected`.  Otherwise return the current value of `*ptr` without writing.
Must be lock-free; implement with the native ISA atomic instruction.

### `ulmk_arch_atomic_add`

```c
uint32_t ulmk_arch_atomic_add(volatile uint32_t *ptr, uint32_t val);
```

Atomically add `val` to `*ptr`.  Return the value **before** the add.

---

## 10. Boot Entry

### `ulmk_arch_init`

```c
void ulmk_arch_init(ulmk_boot_info_t *info);
```

One-time CPU and peripheral initialisation.  Called from `ulmk_kern_start()`
after `ulmk_board_init()`, `.data` copy, and `.bss` zero.  Fills `*info` and
returns; control passes to `ulmk_kern_main()`.

Mandatory sequence:

1. Initialise the saved-context resource pool (CSA free list, register
   windows, or equivalent).
2. Register trap/interrupt vectors and ISR stack (`ulmk_arch_irq_vectors_init`).
3. Initialise the MPU (`ulmk_arch_mpu_init`).
4. Populate `*info`:
   - `mem[]` / `mem_count`: available physical RAM regions.
   - `csa_pool_base` / `csa_pool_size`: saved-context pool (or zeros if the
     arch does not use a hardware pool).

### `ulmk_board_init`

```c
void ulmk_board_init(void);
```

Board-level early hardware setup.  Called from `ulmk_kern_start()` **before**
`.data` copy.

Constraints:
- No initialised global variables available.
- No `ulmk_*` API calls.
- No interrupt enable.
- Must return normally.

Provided by the board in its `ULMK_BOARD_SOURCES`.  For QEMU / boards that need
no early init this is an empty function.

### `ulmk_kern_main`

```c
void ulmk_kern_main(const ulmk_boot_info_t *info);
```

Platform-independent kernel entry.  Called by `ulmk_kern_start()` after
`ulmk_arch_init()`.  Does not return.  Declared here so the boot chain can call
it without depending on internal kernel headers.  Must never be called from user
code.

### `ulmk_kern_start`

```c
void ulmk_kern_start(void);
```

Common C runtime bring-up, shared by every port and implemented once in
`kernel/init/init.c`.  `startup.S` jumps here after the CPU-mandatory prologue
(interrupts disabled, stack set; on TriCore the CSA free list and small-data
anchors too).  It relocates `.data`, clears `.bss`, then calls `ulmk_board_init()`,
`ulmk_arch_init()` and `ulmk_kern_main()`.  Does not return.

A new port's `startup.S` therefore implements **only** the prologue and jumps to
`ulmk_kern_start` — the data/bss relocation is never re-implemented per arch.

---

## 11. Character Output Primitive

```c
void ulmk_printk_char_out(char c);
```

Single-character output to the board's debug console.  Must be provided by the
board as a **strong** (non-weak) symbol in `ULMK_BOARD_SOURCES`.

Called by the kernel printk subsystem and by the arch fault handler before the
scheduler is running.  Must be safe to call very early (before IRQs are
enabled).

---

## 12. Kernel Callbacks (arch → kernel)

These are implemented in `kernel/` and called by the arch port from ISR handlers
and the syscall path.  They contain **no arch-specific code**; all hardware
state must be extracted by the arch before calling.

### `ulmk_kern_irq_dispatch`

```c
void ulmk_kern_irq_dispatch(uint8_t srpn);
```

Route hardware interrupt `srpn` to its bound notification object.  Called from
the generic ISR stub before returning from the interrupt.

### `ulmk_kern_sched_dispatch`

```c
void ulmk_kern_sched_dispatch(bool from_isr);
```

Check whether a higher-priority thread became ready during the trap handler
and yield the CPU before returning to the interrupted context.

- `from_isr == true` — called after `ulmk_kern_irq_dispatch()` on ISR exit.
  TriCore may arm a deferred asm switch; RISC-V performs `ctx_switch` in C.
- `from_isr == false` — called after `ulmk_kern_trap_syscall()` before
  restoring the syscall caller.

**Scheduling contract:**

| Action | API |
|--------|-----|
| Wake a thread (IPC, notif, spawn) | `ulmk_sched_enqueue()` only |
| Voluntary block / yield / exit | `ulmk_sched_resched()` |
| Trap exit preemption | `ulmk_kern_sched_dispatch(from_isr)` |

### `ulmk_kern_trap_syscall`

```c
uint32_t ulmk_kern_trap_syscall(uint8_t tin, uint32_t args[4]);
```

Dispatch a syscall.  `tin` is the syscall number; `args[0..3]` are the four
argument registers read by the syscall entry stub.  Returns the value to be
written as the syscall return value.

### `ulmk_kern_trap_recoverable`

```c
void ulmk_kern_trap_recoverable(void);
```

Kill the current thread after an isolatable hardware fault (e.g., MPU violation
in a user thread).  The arch calls this when the fault can be attributed to a
single thread and the kernel can continue running.

### `ulmk_kern_trap_panic`

```c
void ulmk_kern_trap_panic(void);
```

Halt the system after an unrecoverable fault (kernel fault, ISR fault, or any
fault that cannot be isolated to a single user thread).

---

## 13. TriCore TC2xx Reference Implementation Notes

This section documents implementation decisions specific to the TriCore TC1.6.x
port (`arch/tricore/`).  It is **not** part of the generic contract.

### Files

| File | Implements |
|------|-----------|
| `arch.c` | CPU control, MPU (DPR/CPR), IRQ (SRC), tick (per-core STM CMP0), syscall/trap entry, `ulmk_arch_timer_wheel_cpu` |
| `smp.c` | GPSR IPI (SETR + SRB TRIG), secondary bring-up (CPU1/CPU2) |
| `ctx_switch.S` | `ulmk_arch_ctx_switch` — SVLCX/RSLCX/PCXI swap |
| `startup.S` | `_start` — CPU prologue only (interrupts off, stack, CSA pool, small-data), jumps to `ulmk_kern_start` |
| `vectors.S` | Trap handlers, generic ISR stubs, syscall entry stub |

### Tick and SMP (TC275)

Each core owns its STM module (`STM0`/`STM1`/`STM2` at `0xF0000000` /
`0xF0000100` / `0xF0000200`) and arms CMP0 → `SRC_STMx_SR0` with TOS set to
that CPU (TOS encoding: 0/1/2 for CPU0/1/2; 3=DMA).  Sharing STM0 CMP0+CMP1 across
cores raced on silicon; per-core STM avoids that.  `ulmk_arch_timer_wheel_cpu()`
returns `cpu_id`.  Remote ready threads still get a GPSR IPI for prompt
preemption.  QEMU TriCore builds remain UP (`NUM_CPU=1`); silicon SMP uses
`ulmk_boards` with `ULMK_ARCH_NUM_CPU=3` and `--enable-smp`.

### `ulmk_arch_ctx_t` on TriCore

```c
typedef struct {
	uint32_t pcxi;      /* CSA chain head (PCXI link word) */
} ulmk_arch_ctx_t;
```

`pcxi` is the PCXI register value encoding a two-frame CSA chain:

After every context save (cooperative switch or ISR preempt), assembly stores
`pcxi` then calls `ulmk_arch_ctx_post_save()` — an O(1) sync (head link read +
`dsync`).  Thread destroy walks the chain in `ulmk_arch_ctx_free()` (cold O(d)).

```
pcxi → lower-context CSA (UL=0, saved by SVLCX)
      → upper-context CSA (UL=1, saved by hardware on CALL/trap/ISR)
```

### Context switch sequence

```asm
svlcx                    ; save lower context to a free CSA
mfcr   d15, #PCXI        ; read head of saved chain
st.w   [a4], d15         ; from->pcxi = PCXI
ld.w   d15, [a5]         ; d15 = to->pcxi
dsync                    ; flush CSA writes before modifying PCXI
mtcr   #PCXI, d15        ; PCXI = to->pcxi
isync                    ; pipeline sync (mandatory after any MTCR)
rslcx                    ; restore lower context
rfe                      ; restore upper context + PSW + PC
```

### Initial PSW for `ulmk_arch_ctx_init`

```
PSW.IO  = priv    (0=user, 1=driver, 2=supervisor)
PSW.IS  = 0       (thread uses own stack, not ISP)
PSW.CDE = 1
PSW.CDC = 0x7F    (call-depth counter disabled)
PSW.PRS = 0       (kernel PRS; switched at first context switch)
```

`PSW.IS = 0` is critical.  If set to 1, the CPU uses the ISP register as the
stack pointer instead of A10, corrupting the ISR stack.

### CSA pool invariants

- Pool in fast local DSPR RAM only — never in Flash.
- 64-byte aligned; each CSA frame = 64 bytes.
- `ISYNC` after every `MTCR` on any CSFR.
- `DSYNC` before `MTCR #PCXI` when a CSA was written manually.

### IRQ and CCPN

The syscall entry path sets `CCPN = 255` immediately, disabling all hardware
IRQs for the syscall duration.  This avoids the need for IRQ-save critical
sections inside most syscall handlers.

### SYSCALL register clobbers (userspace ABI, §13.4)

Class-6 entry is `call ulmk_arch_syscall_entry; rfe`.  `call` saves only the
**upper context** (D8–D15, A10–A15); `rfe` restores only that.  The C handler
therefore clobbers the entire **lower context** (D0–D7, A2–A7) from the
caller's point of view — the argument registers D4–D7 are read on entry but are
*not* preserved across the trap.  The `ULMK_SYSCALL_N()` inline-asm macros in
`arch/tricore/include/ulmk_syscall_abi.h` must reflect this: the argument
registers are declared read-write (`"+d"`) and every remaining lower-context
register is listed as a clobber.  Omitting them lets the compiler assume an
argument register (e.g. D6) survives two back-to-back syscalls and reuse the
stale value — a silent memory corruptor that only surfaces under `-O2` register
reuse (e.g. two consecutive `ulmk_ep_reply_recv()` calls).  This differs from
RV32, where the trap handler saves and restores the full GPR file, so only `a0`
(the return value) changes and input-only arg constraints are correct.

Interrupt sources use SRC (Service Request Control) registers.  The SRC block
base and SRE bit position are defined in `boards/<soc>/board_config.h` as
`ULMK_BOARD_SRC_BASE` and `ULMK_BOARD_SRC_SRE_BIT`; the arch port applies
standard AURIX bit layout from `arch_config.h`.

### Trap class routing

| Class | Name | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Internal Protection | `ulmk_kern_trap_recoverable()` |
| 3 TIN 1 | FCD (free list near empty) | log warning, continue |
| 3 TIN 4 | FCU (free list exhausted) | `ulmk_kern_trap_panic()` |
| 6 | System Call | `ulmk_kern_trap_syscall(tin, args)` |
| Others | Various | `ulmk_kern_trap_panic()` |

## 14. RISC-V RV32 Reference Implementation Notes

This section documents implementation decisions specific to the RISC-V RV32 port
(`arch/riscv/`).  It is **not** part of the generic contract.

### Files

| File | Implements |
|------|-----------|
| `arch.c` | CPU idle (WFI), PMP (`ulmk_arch_mpu_*`), syscall/trap dispatch, atomics |
| `ctx_switch.S` | Software save/restore of callee-saved registers (+ optional FPU) |
| `trap.S` | Machine trap entry, interrupt/exception demux, preempt resume |
| `startup.S` | `_start` — CPU prologue only (clear MIE, stack), jumps to `ulmk_kern_start` |
| `irq.c` | IRQ glue to `ulmk_arch_irq_src_*` |
| `irq_clint.c` | MSIP / MTIP (CLINT) backend |
| `irq_plic.c` | PLIC claim/complete backend |

### Privilege and syscalls

- Kernel runs in **M-mode**; user threads run in **U-mode** (`mstatus.MPP=0`).
- Syscalls use `ecall`; number in `a7`, args in `a0`–`a3`, return in `a0`.
- Drivers (`ULMK_PRIV_DRIVER`) enter U-mode via `_ulmk_thread_trampoline_u` + `mret`.

### PMP layout

Static slots (NAPOT): kernel exec, kernel RAM, user text, user RAM, MMIO.
Dynamic slots (`ULMK_ARCH_PMP_USER_BASE`+): per-thread regions from
`ulmk_arch_mpu_switch()`.  `boards/*/memory.ld` must export
`_ulmk_mem_*` symbols for region bounds.

On trap entry the port switches to the kernel PMP layout, then restores the
current thread layout before `mret`.

### IRQ backends

`board_config.h` sets `ULMK_ARCH_HAVE_CLINT` / `ULMK_ARCH_HAVE_PLIC`.
SoC base addresses are **board** symbols in `board_config.h` (`ULMK_BOARD_*`);
`arch_config.h` applies architecture-standard offsets only.

Timer drivers must use **MMIO** (`ulmk_mem_map` with `ULMK_MMAP_PERIPH`), not
the `time` CSR (inaccessible from U-mode).

### Preemption from interrupt

RISC-V saves a 128-byte trap frame on the thread stack.  ISR preemption uses
`ulmk_sched_trap_dispatch(true)` → `ulmk_arch_sched_switch()` with
`ULMK_SCHED_SWITCH_COOP` so the switch returns through the trap epilogue on
`mret`.  TriCore arms `g_preempt_*` via `ULMK_SCHED_SWITCH_PREEMPT_ISR`.

See `docs/arch/riscv_implementation.md` for the full RISC-V porting guide.

## 15. ARM Cortex-M Reference Implementation Notes

This section documents implementation decisions specific to the ARM Cortex-M port
(`arch/arm/`).  It covers **ARMv7-M** (Cortex-M4F/M7) and **ARMv8-M mainline**
(Cortex-M33).  It is **not** part of the generic contract.

### Files

| File | Implements |
|------|-----------|
| `arch.c` | CPU idle (WFI), SVC/SysTick/IRQ/fault C dispatch, atomics, boot bring-up |
| `ctx_switch.S` | Synchronous coroutine switch by swapping MSP (no PendSV) |
| `trap.S` | SVC/exception assembly entry, first-thread launch |
| `startup.S` | `_start` — MSP reload, VTOR, FPU enable, jumps to `ulmk_kern_start` |
| `vectors.S` | Kernel vector table (`_ulmk_vector_table`) |
| `mpu_v7m.c` | PMSAv7 MPU (`RBAR`/`RASR`) — compiled when `!ULMK_ARCH_ARMV8M` |
| `mpu_v8m.c` | PMSAv8 MPU (`RBAR`/`RLAR` + `MAIR`) — compiled when `ULMK_ARCH_ARMV8M` |
| `irq.c` | NVIC glue for `ulmk_arch_irq_src_*` |

The two MPU backends are both listed in the build; each is `#if`-guarded on
`ULMK_ARCH_ARMV8M` so only the one matching the target contributes code.  v7-M
vs v8-M differences elsewhere use the same compile-time switch.

### Context switch model (no PendSV)

Cortex-M exceptions always run on **MSP**, so the port gives every thread a
private **kernel stack** and performs a **synchronous coroutine switch** by
saving/restoring MSP (and callee-saved + optional FP regs) in
`ulmk_arch_ctx_switch` (`ctx_switch.S`).  PendSV is **never** used — this keeps
the switch deterministic and identical to the cooperative model of the other
ports.  The very first thread is launched from Handler mode via
`SVC #ULMK_ARCH_SVC_LAUNCH` (`g_arm_first_launch` carries its context).

### Privilege and syscalls

- Kernel runs **privileged (Handler/Thread on MSP)**; user threads run
  **unprivileged Thread mode** (`CONTROL.nPRIV=1`).  Both `ULMK_PRIV_USER` and
  `ULMK_PRIV_DRIVER` map to unprivileged mode; peripheral reach for drivers is
  granted through the MPU (and, on v8-M boards behind a PPC, `ulmk_board_init`).
- Syscalls use the **`SVC`** instruction; the SVC C dispatcher decodes the
  immediate and routes to `syscall_router` (numbers in `include/ulmk/syscall_nr.h`,
  ABI in `arch/arm/include/ulmk_syscall_abi.h`).
- IRQ masking uses **`PRIMASK`** (`cpsid i` / `cpsie i`).

### FPU

The FPU is **enabled at startup** (CPACR CP10/CP11) when
`ULMK_ARCH_HAVE_FPU` is set — **default on**, disable via the `arch_config`
symbol as on RISC-V.  Lazy FP stacking is disabled; FP callee-saved registers
are saved/restored explicitly by the context switch.

### MPU layout

Static regions cover kernel exec, kernel RAM, peripherals and the user
image; `ulmk_arch_mpu_switch()` reprograms the per-thread data/exec regions.
`boards/*/memory.ld` exports the `_ulmk_mem_*` bounds.  Region 0 is the
kernel/background region with full access.

### Boards and preemption

QEMU boards: `boards/qemu_mps2_an500` (Cortex-M7, ARMv7-M) and
`boards/qemu_mps2_an505` (Cortex-M33, ARMv8-M).  The AN505 boots **Secure** and
its peripherals sit behind the IoTKit **PPC**; `boards/qemu_mps2_an505/board_init.c`
grants unprivileged peripheral access at boot and is linked in *every* build
(including tests that skip the board service threads).

SysTick drives the scheduler tick.  ISR preemption uses
`ulmk_sched_trap_dispatch(true)` → `ulmk_arch_sched_switch()`; the switch is the
same synchronous MSP swap used cooperatively (no PendSV tail-chaining).
